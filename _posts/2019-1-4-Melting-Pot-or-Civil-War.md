title: Melting Pot or Civil War – Reihan Salam.
---

I recently read this book because I wanted to diversify my media. I realized that being on a college campus has surrounded me by people who lean left. Having grown up in a city has put a subconscious bias in me. And finally, my family and friends all have the same bias as well. So for years when I get recommended a book, video, or movie, there is a good chance that it will be biased towards the left. In an interest to correct for this and sympathize with other views, I tried to find a book written by a conservative writer.

Melting Pot or Civil War is written by Reihan Salam, the executive editor for the National Review. The subtitle of the book effectively describes the book’s position, “The Son of Immigrants Makes the Case Against Open Borders”. I found the book extremely eye-opening. Amongst other things, I was shocked to find how much the average American agrees on policy surrounding immigration if politics are removed from the equation. It seems like the political parties have polarized the issue. Overall, most people are comfortable with skilled immigration and with asylum seekers. Media has just portrayed the current state of immigration differently for different people.

I found that Salam’s argument boils down to the following – There is nothing wrong with immigration. But if America allows low skill immigrants right now, it could be dangerous because the American Dream is not what it used to be and upward mobility for those individuals is unlikely. This will result in a disastrous class tension with a racial undertone.
