title: Cook, the new Ballmer
---

Tim Cook is the new Steve Ballmer.

The book good to great makes the assertion that a good leader makes their company successful, a great leader makes their company so successful that their successor will look good. And one thing is clear, Both Steve Jobs and Bill Gates were great leaders.

When Bill Gates stepped down as CEO from Microsoft in the early 2000s, Steve Ballmer inherited a pipeline of products that were incredibly successful. Microsoft had developed windows and PC's which were so far ahead of their competition that anybody could have run that company to success. Eventually, about 8 years later, Steve Ballmer was required to develop a product of his own and Vista was the outcome. Steve Ballmer went on the become one of the consistently lowest rated CEO in history.

Similar to Ballmer, Tim Cook inherited a gold mine. Steve Jobs had brilliantly engineered a line of products that were incomparable with an ecosystem between the products that no other company had the vision to design. Now, despite what the revenue says, Tim Cook is running the company into the ground. Since Steve Jobs left, Tim Cook has released nothing innovative and is slowly letting the competition catch up.

This year marks the first where apple's only advantage to its competitors is the ecosystem between its products. And within another 3 years, competitors will copy that as well. In 5 years, apple is going to be in a lot of trouble and will need to find a new CEO.

My only hope is that Cook becomes as fun as Ballmer became post Microsoft. I wonder what the Cook curve will be.
