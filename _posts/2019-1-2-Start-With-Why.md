title: Start With Why
---

Today, I am starting a blog. I believe blogging will help me

* Retain information
* Formulate my opinions
* Connect with others
* Become a better writer

My biggest resistance to creating a blog has been a concern of the time commitment. Themostdangerouswritingapp.com has resolved this concern because I am timebound to 5 minutes of writing. If I stop typing for ~3 seconds, all of my writing is erased. I feel this will be an effective way for me to regularly blog without having to spend too much time perfecting what I want to say. This will act as an unfiltered stream of consciousness. I plan to include things I have learned, opinions I have, and other thoughts into this blog.
