title: Hand Soap ftw
---


The other day I went to a bar and noticed that they used Myers hand soap. For those who are unfamiliar, Myers is like the apple of hand soaps - Very aesthetically pleasing, but significantly overpriced. On Amazon, Myers hand soap runs for $3.50 and an equal sized off-brand soap goes for $.99. Myers is one of those brands that you can tell, just by looking at it, that it is expensive. My question is why did a relatively cheap and mediocre bar decide to splurge on their hand soap?

I think it may have been one of their best decisions. Everybody wants to get a good deal. While the bar was relatively inexpensive and had the ambiance of an inexpensive bar, this soap could have very easily enhanced patrons' experience to believe that they were getting a quality bar experience with the price of an inexpensive bar. 

This would be a relatively easy hypothesis to test. Have a control group that attends the bar when it has ordinary soap. After their visit, ask the patrons to rate their impression of the quality of the bar. Then repeat the same on a day when serving Myers. My hypothesis is that the quality of the bar will be higher solely due to having an expensive hand soap.
