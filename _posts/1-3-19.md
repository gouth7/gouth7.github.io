Facebook is currently under a lot of heat from the press over missteps with regards to privacy and data. Although, people my age, myself included, seem indifferent to their missteps. I believe this is because young people view Facebook solely as a means for messaging people and creating events. Everything else defaults to Instagram.

While Instagram is still owned by Facebook, it seems they have gone out of their way to make the two social media feel distinct. And nobody has privacy and data concerns with Instagram. But with facebook fading out as a social media, what is their game plan?

I believe they are working on becoming the backbone of the internet. Facebook is already used as a digital ID. Many people use Facebook to log in and authenticate to other websites, or share their photos and information. Examples range from khan academy to tinder. But beyond that, Facebook is also the primary peer to peer communication platform (messenger).
