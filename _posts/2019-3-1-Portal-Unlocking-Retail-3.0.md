title: Portal - Unlocking  Retail 3.0
---

Portal is my entrepreneurship senior design project. We are tasked with building a physical product to sell and later turn into a company. My team settled on a distributed network of automated retail kiosks. Or in simpler terms, amazon go meets vending machines. We think that very often, people are at a location, and are willing to buy things if the item was directly in front of them. Examples of this include: sunscreen at a pool, protein shakes at a gym and toothpaste at an apartment complex.

So why is this different than just a vending machine that holds unique items? We believe this is a paradigm shift within retail.
Retail 1.0 = brick  and mortar, Walmart
Retail 2.0 = E-commerce, Amazon
Retail 3.0 = Technology x In person, Portal

Portal combines the best parts of retail 1.0 and retail 2.0 giving people access to a world of products without waiting 2 days for shipping.

Portal has three stakeholders and benefits all of them. Consumers get access to products they need instantaneously. Brands get direct to consumer exposure. And Locations get to serve their customers better.

Ex. A local gym doesn't want a vending machine because they are unhealthy. Portal will allow them to sell anything they want including protein shakes and protein bars.

Ex. A local protein shake startup doesn't have $250,000 to pay in slotting fees to get into Target. Nor do they have $100,000 to spend on Facebook Ads. Instead, Portal will allow them to reach their customers at local gyms instantaneously.
