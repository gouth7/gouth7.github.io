title: Uber's Path to Mediocrity
---

Uber is the yahoo of the internet. Before the internet, there were yellow pages which served as the reference guide for most people. Similarly, before uber, there were yellow taxis that served as the transportation solution. Then came the internet and Yahoo was the search engine and starting point. Similarly, uber served as the new age solution to transportation. But like Yahoo, Uber’s future does not look bright.

Despite being successful and having tons of revenue, Uber is hemorrhaging over a 1Billion dollars per quarter doing research on autonomous cars. Their ~70Billion dollars in funding are banking on the promise that uber can get rid of drivers (their biggest cost). But the problem is that getting rid of driver’s also gets rid of their competitive advantage.

In 5 years, autonomous cars will be ubiquitous. Regardless of who reaches the milestone first, shortly after the rest of the competition will catch up. At which point, Uber is no better than I am at deploying a fleet of autonomous cars to act as taxis. Today I would have a really tough time competing with Uber because they have a massive first movers advantage and a huge network of drivers and riders.

Uber’s eventual game plan resets their first mover’s advantage and removes their moat. Suddenly, with autonomous taxis, they will have to compete against any autonomous car owner, fleets owned by rental companies like Hertz, and Tesla’s own fleet system.

But if Uber is Yahoo, then who is Google?
