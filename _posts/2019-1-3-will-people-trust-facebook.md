title: Will People Trust Facebook with Money?
---

Facebook is currently under a lot of heat from the press over missteps with regards to privacy and data. Although, people my age, myself included, seem indifferent to their missteps. I believe this is because young people view Facebook solely as a means for messaging people and creating events. Everything else defaults to Instagram.

While Instagram is still owned by Facebook, it seems they have gone out of their way to make the two social media feel distinct. And nobody has privacy and data concerns with Instagram. But with facebook fading out as a social media, what is their game plan?

I believe they are working on becoming the backbone of the internet. Facebook is already used as a digital ID. Many people use Facebook to log in and authenticate to other websites, or share their photos and information. Examples range from khan academy to tinder. But beyond that, Facebook is also the primary peer to peer communication platform (messenger).

Facebook recently revealed that they are working on a crypto/blockchain solution. I think this will cement them as the backbone of the internet. Leveraging their userbase, they can be the gateway from fiat to crypto. Because most people already have Venmo, peer to peer transactions are taken care of. But the true value of blockchain is interoperability (allowing users to move money from Venmo to Robinhood, to Amazon and back instantaneously). Facebook will use its cryptocurrency as a means of transmission between institutions.

When a user connects their bank account to Facebook, they will charge the account in a traditional way and wait 3-5 days for the money to arrive. But in the meantime, Facebook will be able to fulfill the transaction to wherever it needs to go instantaneously.

Alternatively, Facebook will pull a Robinhood and create a checking account. But at the end of the day, will people trust Facebook with money?
