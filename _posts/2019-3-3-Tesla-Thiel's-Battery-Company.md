title: Tesla, Thiel's Battery Company
---

2019 has been a crazy 2 months for Tesla. Between Elon Musk getting fined for his tweets, to finally producing the sought after $35,000 car, the company has got its fair share of media attention. In my mind, none of this matters, because by 2025 they wont even make cars.

Why?

Elon Musk has created a luxury car company. While other silicon valley giants like Apple and Facebook are stocking their cash reserves for the impending recession, Tesla seems to love living on the edge. But the worst part is that the demand for Tesla's products is extremely elastic; come recession time, people may not be lining up to drop $35k+ on an electric car. That coupled with Uber pool and autonomous vehicles, the demand for cars, in general, will only reduce.

But all is not doomed for the popular automaker. The real innovation behind Tesla is its battery technology. And the company stands for too much to go under; Tesla is beloved by the people and is one of few profitable cleantech companies. Thus, Tesla can always fall back on their battery technology, where they are likely 3+ years ahead of competitors.

Unfortunately, knowing Elon, between now and then he will likely say/do something stupid and lose control of his company.

My prediction: Elon leaves Tesla as they struggle through the next recession. Afterward, a silicon valley veteran (Thiel?) picks up the pieces, sells batteries, and succeeds.
